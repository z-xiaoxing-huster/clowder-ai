/**
 * WorklistRegistry — per-thread worklist for A2A unification (F27)
 *
 * When routeSerial is running, it registers its worklist here.
 * Callback A2A triggers (MCP post_message with @mention) push
 * targets into the worklist instead of spawning independent invocations.
 *
 * This eliminates the dual-path problem:
 * - Path A (worklist): @mention in cat response text → worklist extends
 * - Path B (callback): @mention in MCP post_message → now ALSO extends worklist
 *
 * All A2A chains share the parent's AbortController, isFinal semantics,
 * and MAX_A2A_DEPTH limit.
